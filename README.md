React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh


To run the application

step-1 run npm install in search-animation directory

step-2 run npm run dev in search-animation directory

Note :-
Application uses Framer Motion which requires LTS Node.js version (e.g., Node.js 18 or 20) to ensure smooth operation with Framer Motion.
